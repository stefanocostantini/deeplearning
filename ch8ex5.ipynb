    "1. _Generator network_ — Takes as input a random vector (a random point in the latent space), and decodes it into a synthetic image\n",

    "A GAN is a system where the optimization minimum isn’t fixed, unlike in any other training setup you’ve encountered in this book. Normally, gradient descent consists of rolling down hills in a static loss landscape. But with a GAN, every step taken down the hill changes the entire landscape a little. It’s a dynamic system where the optimization process is seeking not a minimum, but an equilibrium between two forces. For this reason, GANs are notoriously difficult to train—getting a GAN to work requires lots of careful tuning of the model architecture and training parameters."

    "2. A discriminator network maps images of shape (32, 32, 3) to a binary score estimating the probability that the image is real.\n",
    "3. A gan network chains the generator and the discriminator together: gan(x) = discriminator(generator(x)). Thus this gan network maps latent space vec- tors to the discriminator’s assessment of the realism of these latent vectors as decoded by the generator.\n",
    "4. You train the discriminator using examples of real and fake images along with “real”/“fake” labels, just as you train any regular image-classification model.\n",
    "5. To train the generator, you use the gradients of the generator’s weights with regard to the loss of the gan model. This means, at every step, you move the weights of the generator in a direction that makes the discriminator more likely to classify as “real” the images decoded by the generator. In other words, you train the generator to fool the discriminator."
